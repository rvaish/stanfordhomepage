            <p>
I am a research scientist at Snap Research. Previously, I was a <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/rajan-vaish" target="_blank">postdoctoral researcher</a> at Stanford University, where I worked with <a href="https://5harad.com/" target="_blank">Sharad Goel</a> and <a href="http://stanford.edu/~saberi/" target="_blank">Amin Saberi</a> in the <a href="http://msande.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">MS&E</a> department and <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/msb/" target="_blank">Michael Bernstein</a> in the <a href="http://www-cs.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">CS</a> department. My research interests include human-computer interaction, crowdsourcing, education, social and mobile computing. The focus of my work at Stanford was to scale traditionally hard and open-ended complex endeavors — <a href="https://aspiringresearchers.soe.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">research</a>, <a href="http://scholar.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">teaching</a>, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21729025.500-social-whodunnit-competition-launches-in-india#.UjkOTcakqWU" target="_blank">time-critical campaigns</a>, <a href="http://stanfordhci.github.io/twitchcrowdsourcing/" target="_blank">data collection</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/crowdtone-crowd-powered-tone-feedback-improvement-system-emails/" target="_blank">writing</a> — where I designed and developed computational models and systems to coordinate and empower large number of people to make long-term substantial contributions. I strongly care about making <a href="#crowdresearch">scientific contribution</a> and <a href="#scholar">scientific knowledge</a> more accessible and open.

<br><br>
In past, I spent most of my grad school (three years) working with Michael Bernstein at the <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford HCI Group</a>, and was advised by <a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~davis/" target="_blank">James Davis</a> at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">U.C. Santa Cruz</a>, where I earned my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computer-science" target="_blank">CS</a>. During grad school, I also worked with various groups - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reid-porter-ab912366" target="_blank">Reid Porter</a> at <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/" target="_blank">LANL</a>, <a href="http://www.andresmh.com/" target="_blank">Andrés Monroy-Hernández</a> and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/teevan/" target="_blank">Jaime Teevan</a> at <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/redmond/" target="_blank">MSR Redmond</a>, <a href="https://www.parc.com/about/people/13/victoria-bellotti.html" target="_blank">Victoria Bellotti</a> at <a href="https://www.parc.com/" target="_blank">PARC</a>, <a href="http://suif.stanford.edu/~lam/" target="_blank">Monica Lam</a> at <a href="http://www.omlet.me/" target="_blank">MobiSocial, Inc.</a>, <a href="http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-michael_muller" target="_blank">Michael Muller</a> and <a href="http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-Werner.Geyer" target="_blank">Werner Geyer</a> at <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/watson/visitor_cambridge.shtml" target="_blank">IBM T.J.

    <p> <a name="crowdresearch"></a><h3>Stanford Crowd Research Initiative: Enabling Global Access to Research at Scale (MOOR)</h3> <br>
      <b>Collaborators</b>: Michael Bernstein, Sharad Goel, Geza Kovacs, Ranjay Krishna, Camelia Simoiu, Imanol Arrieta Ibarra at Stanford University. Michael Wilber, Andreas Veit and Serge Belongie at Cornell Tech. James Davis at University of California, Santa Cruz. Snehalkumar (Neil) Gaikwad at MIT Media Lab. Over 1,500 students worldwide.<br><br>

      The <a href="https://aspiringresearchers.soe.ucsc.edu/">Aspiring Researchers Challenge</a> a.k.a. Stanford Crowd Research is an experiment in <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/news/article/2352">massive open online research (MOOR)</a>, that explores the possibility of research at scale by connecting an expert with crowd (aspiring researchers). In span of six months, we had more than 1,000 sign ups from people around the world with almost no research experience - more than 90% had never published a paper before, about 25% were female and more than 70% were undergraduates.
We developed a weekly structure that helped in coordinating crowd, distribute fair credits, educate and train them about research topics and process. The structure utilized peer review to scale the process, that would include series of research phases like, brainstorming, prototyping, development and user-evaluation. Crowd contributed through engineering, design, paper writing and other core aspects of research. <br><br> 
Through our approach, participants worked on <a href="https://aspiringresearchers.soe.ucsc.edu/project.html">three projects</a> in computer vision, data science and human-computer interaction (HCI) - mentored by professors at Stanford University and UC Santa Cruz. And were able to successfully publish one full paper at ACM UIST 2016, one at ACM CSCW 2017 and three work-in-progress papers at top-tier conferences in computer science - <a href="http://uist.acm.org/uist2015/about">ACM UIST</a> and <a href="http://www.humancomputation.com/2015/">AAAI HCOMP</a>. Many students have gone on to undergrad and graduate school at MIT, Stanford, UC Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, Cornell and more. We believe that the project is a first step towards realizing research on a wider scale.<BR> <BR><BR><BR><BR>

      <b>Collaborators</b>: Sharad Goel, Amin Saberi at Stanford University. Over 800 students worldwide.<br><br>

      There are millions of research papers that go unread, some are behind paywall, while some are hard for non-researchers to read and understand. Besides writing papers, researchers lack time and resources to make their work available in other forms or formats. Meanwhile, there's been a shift in consuming information and knowledge through videos. Through this initiative, we're trying to make world's research more accessible - by mobilizing people worldwide to scale the traditional video creation process, and collaboratively create short talks on influential papers - that can be improved/edited by anyone. To accomplish this goal, we're designing a scaffolding process to coordinate the crowd, and building a system to enable collaborative and editable video production. Beyond research talks, we're applying our techniques to develop courses. Eventually, this research can help open-ended media collaboration - from education to journalism, and beyond.

      While there has been a <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~cebrian/p78-tang.pdf">surge of interest</a> in mobilizing the crowd to solve large-scale time-critical challenges, to date such work has focused on high income countries and Internet-based solutions. In developing countries, approaches for crowd mobilization are often broader and more diverse, utilizing not only the Internet but also face-to-face and mobile communications. <a href="http://www.whodunitchallenge.com/">The Whodunit Challenge</a> is first of its kind social mobilization contest to be launched in India. The contest enabled participation via basic mobile phones and required rapid formation of large teams in order to solve a fictional mystery case. The challenge encompassed 7,700 participants in a single day and was won by a university team in about 5 hours. To understand teams strategies and experiences, we conducted 84 phone interviews. While the Internet was an important tool for most teams, in contrast to prior challenges we also found heavy reliance on personal networks and offline communication channels.

    <p><h3>Twitch Crowdsourcing: Crowd Contributions in Short Bursts of Time</h3> <br>
      <b>Collaborators</b>: Michael Bernstein, Keith Wyngarden, Jingshu Chen, Brandon Cheung at Stanford University.<br><br>

      To lower the threshold to participation in crowdsourcing, we present twitch crowdsourcing: crowdsourcing via quick contributions that can be completed in one or two seconds. We introduce Twitch, a mobile phone application that asks users to make a micro-contribution each time they unlock their phone. Twitch takes advantage of the common habit of turning to the mobile phone in spare moments. Twitch crowdsourcing activities span goals such as authoring a census of local human activity, rating stock photos, and extracting structured data from Wikipedia pages. At the time of CHI’14 paper submission, 82 users made 11,240 crowdsourcing contributions as they used their phone in the course of everyday life. After six months of deployment, over 100,000 contributions were registered. The median Twitch activity took just 1.6 seconds, incurring no statistically distinguishable costs to unlock speed or cognitive load compared to a standard slide-to-unlock interface.

      <b>Collaborators</b>: James Davis at U.C. Santa Cruz. Mrunal Gawade at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, Amsterdam. <br><br>

      Microwork in cybercafés is a promising tool for poverty alleviation. For those who cannot afford a computer, cybercafés can serve as a simple payment channel and as a platform to work. However, there are questions about whether workers are interested in working in cybercafés, whether cybercafé owners are willing to host such a set up, and whether workers are skilled enough to earn an acceptable pay rate? We designed experiments in internet/cyber cafes in India and Kenya to investigate these issues. We also investigated whether computers make workers more productive than mobile platforms? In surveys, we found that 99% of the users wanted to continue with the experiment in cybercafé, while 8 of 9 cybercafé owners showed interest to host this experiment. User typing speed was adequate to earn a pay rate comparable to their existing wages, and the fastest workers were approximately twice as productive using a computer platform.

      <b>Collaborators</b>: Michael Muller, Werner Geyer and Todd Soule at IBM T.J. Watson Research, Cambridge, MA. <br><br>

      In this project we contrast crowdfunding as it occurs on the Internet, with crowdfunding in an Enterprise setting, based on a grounded theory analysis of a <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/social/projects_1x5.shtml">crowdfunding trial at IBM Research Almaden</a>. We explore themes of diverse projects, motivations and incentives, strategies and approaches, and collaborations and relationships. Enterprise crowdfunding has its own financial model, social scope, and dynamics, resulting from a heightened sense of collaboration and community. This project helps us learn about the implications for organizations and for future crowdfunding activities.

      Internet is embracing peer-to-peer services, and the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharing_economy">sharing economy</a>" they create. This project aims at exploring how to motivate people to join prosocial p2p services that do not involve monetary rewards.

We conducted a field experiment with a P2P curating platform we created to compare user recruiting strategies that leverage these motivatiors.

    <p><h3>Crowd-Powered Tone Improvement System for Emails</h3> <br>
      <b>Collaborators</b>: Andrés Monroy-Hernández and Jaime Teevan at Microsoft Research Redmond. <br><br>

      Communicating a message with right tone is extremely important, misinterpretation of which can cause confusion or unexpected reaction and response. However, people often fail to express the right tone in their messages due to a lack of skills or the wrong assumptions. Can we help them? There are several automated solutions to detect the tone and identify shortcomings, like <a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/tone-analyzer.html">IBM's Tone Analyzer</a> and <a href="http://tonecheck.com/?__lsa=2cc6-996f">ToneCheck</a>. However, their accuracy and reliability if often doubtful. Also, these applications can give recommendations, but cannot fix the tone of the message or text. As part of our project, our system relies on crowd intelligence to improve the tone of emails. The backend of our system is powered by MTurk, where crowd follows a systematically designed and scaffolded workflow. The system inputs email content and context, and outputs improved email. Based on a study on 29 emails, we found that more than 90\% of the emails went through some or significant improvements.

      <b>3D+2D TV: 3D Displays with No Ghosting for Viewers Without Glasses</b><br>

      3D displays are increasingly popular in consumer and commercial applications. Many such displays show 3D images to viewers wearing special glasses, while showing an incomprehensible double image to viewers without glasses. We demonstrate a simple method that provides those with glasses 3D experience, while viewers without glasses see a 2D image without artifacts.<br>

      <b>Digitization of Health Records in Rural Villages</b>- with <a href="http://www.pamf.org/">PAMF</a><br>

      In this project, we present a study that reviews current available methods for obtaining electronic health records (EHRs) to facilitate the provision of health services to patients from rural villages in developing countries. The study compares processes of digitizing health records by means of manual transcription, both by hiring a professional transcriptionist and by using online crowdsourcing platforms. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis is conducted to compare the studied transcription methods to an alternate technology-based solution that was developed to support in-the-field direct data entry.

            <br><br>
      <b>Using crowdsourcing to generate ground truth data for computer vision training</b><br>

      This project was conducted in <a href="http://institute.lanl.gov/isti/issdm/projects/#302">collaboration with LANL</a>. Computer vision is great, but at times it fails too. To train the algorithms, usually researchers spend several hours annotating images to create ground truths. Why not harness the crowd here? That’s what we’re trying to do, several experiments have been crowdsourced on Mechanical Turk and MobileWorks. The experiment was conducted on two types of data sets, namely: Pedestrians and Bumble-bees. 
        <br><br> 
        <b>Low Effort Crowdsourcing: Leveraging Peripheral Attention for Crowd Work</b> - at CrowdCamp at HCOMP'13, with Jeff Bigham and Haoqi Zhang. <br>

        Crowdsourcing systems leverage short bursts of focused
attention from many contributors to achieve a goal. By
requiring people’s full attention, existing crowdsourcing
systems fail to leverage people’s cognitive surplus in the
many settings for which they may be distracted, performing
or waiting to perform another task, or barely paying
attention. In this project, we study opportunities for loweffort
crowdsourcing that enable people to contribute to
problem solving in such settings. We discuss the design
space for low-effort crowdsourcing, and through a series
of prototypes, demonstrate interaction techniques, mechanisms,
and emerging principles for enabling low-effort
crowdsourcing
